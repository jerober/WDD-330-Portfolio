    <h2>Week Two Notes</h2>
    <p>Var is a variable that acts like a container. It seems to be used within and without a function so I don't think it is local but I am not sure. Also not sure how it compares to const. Key value pairss are a key for a description. In the code example the key is set to the story name and the description is the story inputted. This allows us to call both from storage using JS.</p>
    <h2>Week Two Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Why does targeting an ID in the DOM make such a big difference when using JS than targeting a class?</li>
        <li>How do I know when to use var or const?</li>
    </ul>
