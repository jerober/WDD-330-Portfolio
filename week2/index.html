    <h2>Week Two Notes</h2>
    <p>Var is no longer best practice to use to define a variable. Instead we use const and let. Both can be defined globally and locally depending on if they are in a block or not.If a variable is defined inside a block without the use of let or const than it is a global variable. JS variables follow the camel case syntax. Less than or equal to operators are soft in JS, menaing they use type coersions to make data types the same. E.g. 8 = '8' a number to a string </p>
    <p>Need to go back over function hoisting...</p>
    <h2>Week Two Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Why do truthy and falsey values exist different in JS than most languages?</li>
        <li>When do I use a soft equality operator over a hard equality operator?</li>
        <li>Why would a set be of better use than an array? It seems limiting...</li>
        <li>What are the benefits of the weak sets and maps?</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
