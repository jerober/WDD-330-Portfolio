    <h2>Week Four Notes</h2>
    <p>All of the fields within a form are created inside the form tag, including the end button. Forms are secondary in referencing if they have the same name as a method. You can use changed, blur, or focus as events that can occur as the user interacts with a form. You can access any parts of a form in JS using index notation. For form validation, JS should only be used for usability. Server-side validation should be used for validation before being saved to a database. You can make fields required using HTML but it is not supported by all browsers so be aware of this. There are workarounds. You can also disable the submit button with a function is a field is not entered correctly.</p>
    <p>Spent a lot of time in the code so there are less notes this week.</p>

    <h2>Week Four Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>*Read Designing UX: Forms*</li>
        <li>Where does the form get submitted to when using the form.submit() method?</li>
        <li>I have a hard time understanding what happens during the submit, but I am assuming that is all back-end development so I do not think it is covered in this book.</li>
        <li>What is the benefit of using focus, blur, or changed?</li>
        <li>Why hide a value if it is not secret? When would the hidden attribute be useful?</li>
    </ul>
