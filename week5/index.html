    <h2>Week Five Notes</h2>
    <p>Stack traces identify moving backwards where the issue originated and lists the steps in between. strict mode is used to alert for any basic bad practice errors in js. The best way to use strict mode is to put all of your code into a self-invoking function.</p>
    <p>Linting tools are used to highlight sloppy code. This helps create order and contiguity when multiple people are working in the same code. Additionally, it creates a consistent style throughout the code. Plugins can be created to force people to code using specific styles and syntaxes when multiple options will do.</p>
    <p>Using the alert() method is good for testing. You can also use console.log() for similar purposes, but alert() will stop the program whereas console.log() will not. Console.table() will build a table with the data in the console. Console.trace() will log a stack trace.</p>
    <p>The debugger keyword can be implemented in code to stop the program (it works like a breakpoint) and it is interactive, meaning you can see what variables currently are at that point in the code. It is important to remove debugger code before deployment or else the code will freeze for the users.</p>
    <p>You can create a custom error() with the error function. Additionally, there are seven more built in errors in JS. These are all thrown automatically. To throw custom exceptions you would use the throw keyword.</p>
    <p>When errors are thrown there are ways to handle them so that they don't impede the user. To do this you would need to use try, catch, and finally.</p>
    <h2>Week Five Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When thinking about feature detection, how often do you need to go back and instead of creating errors to pop up, but change it so that it is standard? i realize the answer would be when the feature is standard that should be reflected in the code, but I work on a system that is primarily used by baby boomers and we run across issues all the time that come from users having extremely outdated OS's so how do you design for everyone and when do you optimize code as features become industry standard?</li>
        <li>I feel like console.log() is better than alert(), thoughts?</li>
        <li>I have a hard time understanding what happens during the submit, but I am assuming that is all back-end development so I do not think it is covered in this book.</li>
        <li>What is the benefit of using focus, blur, or changed?</li>
        <li>Why hide a value if it is not secret? When would the hidden attribute be useful?</li>
    </ul>
